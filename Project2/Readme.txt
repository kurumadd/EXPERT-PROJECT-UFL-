There are 3 folders with each of 7 files. Leave them as folders as files have same name but different content. Since there are many files to make it easier for you I have created a batch file for each version.You can find it in with the .clp files. To run the program just go to file load batch file option and load the batch file. It will start the implementation.



Data is specified as deffacts in the program

for city: ;The rule format of city is (city city1 city2 distance_between_them)

;The rule format for the deffact truck is as follows: (truck truck-number current-location destination current-action time-arrival total-space-available space-occupied package destination) 

;The rule format for the deffact package is as follows: (package package-no depart-city delivery-city size order-arrival-time expected-delivery-time) 


When run and all packages that are delivered are inserted as a fact of the format (package_delivered)

I am using clips on windows 8.
